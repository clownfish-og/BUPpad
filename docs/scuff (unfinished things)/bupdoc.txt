BUPpad25
A 25-key macropad for Patrick Richards Twitch emotes
using a Winry25tc keypad with custom QMK firmware and configurable with VIA

1) Hardware
The harware is sourced from AliExpress, although it can also be purchased through re-sellers on ebay, etc.
The keypad is the Winry25, available from the SpiderIsland Tech Co., Ltd Store on AliExpress

There are several configurations of this keypad available under different listings, including different case colors, lighting options, switches, and keycaps.
    The switch options provided can block a lot of the light from the RGB backlighting making it appear dim
    The keycaps offered have standard legends or are blank
I recommend getting a version with lights and without switches or keycaps

I recommend using "relegendable" keycaps, they have a clear plastic window on the top of them where you can insert a paper legend underneath.
There are many different styles of relegendable keycaps. I have provided legend templates for the ones shown here
